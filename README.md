# leetcode_typescript_AWSLambdas
leetcode questions created as AWS lambdas using typescript

I have officially started my journey on the #100daysofCode challege in typescript and AWS and i would be updating the different problems that i pick from leetcode and will try to create functions as solutions to those questions.

I have also attempted to describe the functions as comments as much as possible. 

The files have been structured by the dates they were worked on and they are worked entirely on Typescript and serverless architecture. 

Happy Coding!!
